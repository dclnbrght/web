# {{ title }}

<p>
    This is the <a href="https://www.musikding.de/Propolis-Fuzz-kit">Propolis Fuzz</a> guitar pedal kit from Musikding, it includes a PCB from <a href="https://www.pedalpcb.com/product/propolisfuzz/">PedalPCB</a>. 
</p>
<p>
    The circuit is based on the <a href="https://www.uniontone.com/shop/bumble-buzz">Bumble Buzz</a> from Union Tube &amp; Transistor. It's a gated octave fuzz that was developed in conjunction with <a href="https://thirdmanstore.com/products/black-bumble-buzz-guitar-pedal">Third Man</a>, Jack White's company. 
</p>
<p>
    It's unusual in that it has no knobs, just an on/off footswitch. This isn't much of a limitation however, as it's quite dynamic and sensitive to your playing sytle and guitar volume.
</p>
<p>
    The base kit can be purchased without a pedal enclosure, however they provide an option to purchase a blank or pre-drilled 125B enclosure.

<h2>Preparing the Enclosure</h2>
<p>
    Several coats of matt black paint were applied to the enclosure, followed by some basic masking to add three yellow stripes using acrylic paint. It was finished off with a few coats of matt clear coat spray.

<h2>Assembling the PCB</h2>
<p>
    Soldering the components to the main PCB is relatively easy, everything is clearly labeled so it's a typical assembly, going from lowest to highest components; resistors &amp; diodes to capacitors.
</p>
<p>
    The footswitch has a separate PCB which keeps the wiring tidy.
</p>

<h2>Assembling the Pedal</h2>
<p>
    In general, the build was straight forward, most of the off-board wiring and testing was done before mounting in the enclosure.

    A yellow LED was used instead of the one that came with the kit, in keeping with the bumble bee theme.

    The End Result
</h2>
<p>
    This is a really fun pedal to play. It takes a bit of getting used to and doesn't suit every style of playing but it does create some really interesting sounds.
