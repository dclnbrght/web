			<p>
				When I was at school I decided that I wanted to become a mechanical engineer. I always had an interest in machines and engines and I managed to get myself into the <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofMechanicalandAerospaceEngineering/" target="_blank">mechanical engineering degree course</a> at the <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Queen's University Belfast</a>. While there I found myself working in the engine lab with a guy called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RoadracingLegendSupermac/" target="_blank">Ray McCullough</a>.

				Although I'd didn't realise it initially, Ray was a legend for many years before I was even born, having won many road races on two wheels.

				By the time I got to Queen's, Ray had retired from racing and was working as a technician in the mechanical engineering lab in the Ashby Building on Stranmillis Road. He was working with students on various research projects related to the development of two-stroke engines.

				I was working on a project involving dual ignition, under the supervision of Professor Robert Fleck, former head of the <a href="https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/organisations/school-of-mechanical-and-aerospace-engineering" target="_blank">School of Mechanical &amp; Aerospace Engineering</a> in Queen's. Ray was in the lab to help me build (and rebuild) the test engine on the dynamometer. He was a complete gentleman and I have fond memories of working with him, we even managed to blow the odd <a href="/photo?p=HondaPiston" target="_blank">piston</a>.
			</p>

				The mechanical engineering department of Queen's isn't just involved in the development of two-stroke engines, it also has a long history of involvement with World Championship Grand Prix motorcycle racing. At that time it had teamed up with OPTIMUM Power Technology and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_McWilliams" target="_blank">Jeremy McWilliams</a> as <a href="https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/teams/qub-team-optimum/" target="_blank">QUB Team Optimum</a>. Jeremy was riding a 250cc Honda that year (1997) and it was this Honda engine that I worked on. Jeremy is a nice bloke too, he has managed some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEZf5thwTJI" target="_blank">impressive feats on two wheels</a>, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_German_motorcycle_Grand_Prix">2nd place on a 250cc at the German grand prix in Sachsenring in 1998</a>.

				This is just a small part of a broader story about QUB's involvement in motorcycle racing. I was interviewed for an article on this story for the September 2020 issue of <a href="https://roadracingireland.com/products/rri-september-2020/">Road Racing Ireland magazine</a>.
