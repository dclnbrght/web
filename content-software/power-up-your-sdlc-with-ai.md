Most software engineers are already using AI coding assistants or agents, however the real opportunity lies in using AI across the entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). In this guide, we'll look at how AI agents can be used throughout the process, to deliver better software faster.

## It’s all about Context

Every SDLC process includes phases such as: **Planning & Analysis, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, Support & Maintenance**. Each phase of the process is dependent on contextual information being available, about the business domain, the users, the technologies and the software being developed. 

The key to leveraging the power of AI is to make this information readily available to AI agents, by generating high quality contextual information during each phase and using it to construct high quality prompts and instructions for the subsequent phase. The better the context, the better the AI’s output.

The high level steps to make this happen are:

* Identify the existing sources of information, review and fill any gaps in those sources  
* Provide AI agents with access to the contextual information 
* Upskill the team to refine their ways of working, to reference the appropriate context in each phase
* Apply change management to roll out the changes 

## Model Context Protocol

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/overview) is a powerful open protocol that acts like universal plumbing between existing enterprise systems and AI agents, avoiding custom API integrations. 

A MCP Server is a simple adapter service that (generally) runs in the context of a user, on their laptop and provides consistent interfaces (rather than custom integrations) that an AI agent can interact with. These interfaces provide a means to request contextual information (resources) and to execute tools that will perform actions.

Many of the concepts discussed below can be achieved by manually providing the information to an AI agent, however MCP servers provide a way to automate the flow, avoiding a lot of copying and pasting. e.g. an AI agent can automatically retrieve the details of a task from a work management system when prompted with a ticket number.

A note of caution, some MCP servers expose too much functionality, giving the AI agent excessive agency. This is an example of the risk described in the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs: [LLM08: Excessive Agency](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk2023-24/llm08-excessive-agency/). Either use a proxy or implement your own MCP server to only expose the capabilities that you really need.

## AI Agents Across SDLC Phases

Now that we understand the importance of context and the means of providing it to AI agents, let’s look at how these can be applied to power up each phase of the SDLC. Example prompts are in quotes.

### Planning & Analysis Phase

A product team can utilise AI in multiple ways during the Planning & Analysis phase.

* **Automated research**: use a deep research agent to perform industry analysis or ideation on product development.
  * *“create a report of how industry \[...\] is evolving to use \[...\] products and services* 
  * *“explore ways to enhance the value delivered by the \[...\] product/service*
* **Rapid prototyping**: use an AI prototyping platform to create a UI prototype from an idea (AKA vibe-coding).  
  * *“create a simple web page using HTML, to demonstrate how users can manage/process \[...\] records/data”* 
* **Reverse engineering**: reverse engineer an existing code base to document previously undocumented requirements from legacy systems. This can be a collaboration between a product owner and a software engineer. 
* **Requirements documentation**: draft a Product Requirements Document (PRD) from an initial idea. 
  * *“Create a PRD based on the \[...\] template. The PRD is for a new application feature that does \[...\]"*
* **Work breakdown**: draft Epics, Stories & Tasks from the PRD.
  * *“Create a work breakdown based on the \[...\] PRD. Create an Epic, followed by stories and related tasks, including detailed steps and acceptance criteria."*
* **Draft content**: draft product documentation, presentations, marketing copy etc.

### Design Phase

#### UX Design

* **Automated UX Design**: UX design tools can reference PRD documents and sketches to generate wireframes, user flows, and clickable prototypes.

#### Software Architecture

* **Software design**: draft a software design document from a PRD, based on defined architecture standards and conventions.  
  * *"Based on this PRD, create a high-level software architecture document. Follow our company's architecture standards. Include component, data flow, and technology choices."*
* **Create architecture diagrams**: generate diagrams to communicate the software architecture clearly.
  * *"Generate component and data flow diagrams (Mermaid diagrams in markdown) to represent the \[...\] system architecture."*
* **NFR analysis**: analyse a software design to review Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and identify potential gaps.
  * *"Review the \[...\] software design and highlight any missing aspects or unclear NFRs. Suggest additions based on common software quality attributes."*

### Development Phase

Software engineers can utilise MCP servers from within their coding editors to retrieve the contextual information generated in the previous phases, from UX design systems, wikis and task management tools.

Instruction files (Markdown files) should be created in code repositories to define coding standards, project conventions and to describe the business domain.

* **Task Assignment**: assign a task to an agent, the task should have a detailed description and references to related context sources such as PRD and software design documents.
  * *"Get the details of the task described in ticket: \[...\], review the current project and implement the required changes."*
* **Defect Fix Automation**: reference a task or defect ticket number and ask the agent to implement the required changes to the code.
  * *"Get the details of the defect described in ticket: \[...\], review the current project and implement the required fix. Include unit tests."*
* **Learning a Codebase**: new team members can use an AI agent to learn about an existing codebase.
  * *"I'm a new developer on the team, explain how this business logic works, in plain-English"*

### Testing Phase

* **Automated Test Creation**: create (unit, integration, performance, security) tests by analysing the existing code repository and defect patterns. This is an easy way to increase test coverage and catch future defects.
  * *"Analyze this code in \[...\] file and generate unit tests, cover typical usage scenarios and edge cases. Create mock objects where needed."*
  * *"Write tests to cover the defects in the following tickets: \[..., ...\]"*
* **Test Data Generation**: create synthetic data for testing.
  * *"Create 1000 realistic test records for the \[...\] data model, output as SQL INSERT statements"*
  
A MCP server can also be used to interact with test case management systems.

### Deployment Phase

* **CI/CD Pipeline Generation**: create and execute CI/CD pipelines, including performance analysis, anomaly detection and cloud cost optimisation.
  * *"Create a CI/CD pipeline for the \[...\] application, include steps for build, test, security scan, and deployment to [staging/production] environments."*
  * *"Review the current cloud infrastructure and identify opportunities to reduce costs."*
* **Script Generation**: generate deployment or rollback scripts based on the latest system changes.
  * *"Generate a deployment script for the latest release, including database migrations and service restarts. Also generate a rollback script in case the deployment fails."*

### Support & Maintenance Phase

* **Realtime Monitoring**: monitor and resolve system issues in real time.  
* **Root Cause Analysis**: write up Root Cause Analysis documents based on tickets and logs.  
  * *"Generate a Root Cause Analysis report based on the following incident ticket and log files. Include summary, impact, timeline, root cause, and remediation steps."*
* **Improvement Analysis**: historical support tickets can be analysed to suggest fixes and improvements.
  * *"Analyze the support tickets from the past 6 months. Identify recurring issues or common pain points, and suggest improvements to reduce ticket volume."*

## Team Upskilling & Organisational Change

Everything described above is about augmenting your team, to make their lives easier, it's not about replacing people with AI. The output from any of these steps will not be perfect, there will be inaccuracies that require human review and correction. Even with these imperfections, it’s much better than starting from a blank screen.

Some training and up-skilling will be required to get people onboard and adopt these new ways of working. See [Driving AI Adoption, From Resistance to Results](/software/driving-ai-adoption-from-resistance-to-results/) for more information on change management.  

## AI Governance

Don’t forget about AI governance! Your SDLC process is handling your company's intellectual property, therefore robust governance is vital. More details on AI governance here: [AI Governance & the Journey To ISO 42001](/software/ai-governance-and-the-journey-to-ISO-42001/)  


## Conclusion

Introducing AI agents can enhance the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). While adopting point solutions is a practical way to begin integrating AI, a more strategic approach involves optimising each phase to seamlessly support the next. This creates a more cohesive and effective AI-powered SDLC. Begin by applying these improvements in the Planning & Analysis phase, and continue through the phases, always prioritising the quality and relevance of the context generated at each step.
