# {{ title }} â€“ Guitar Fretboard Learning Tool

Learning the guitar is a journey that combines theory, practice, and a deep understanding of the fretboard. Visualising scales, modes, and notes across the neck is essential for both beginners and advanced players. *fretMonkey* is a simple web application designed as an reference guide to ease the learning experience.

## Background

I created *fretMonkey* to address a common challenge for guitarists: connecting music theory with practical fretboard knowledge. Traditional diagrams and static charts can be limiting. By building an interactive tool, I aim to make it easier to learn the fretboard.

## How it works

*fretMonkey* presents a virtual guitar fretboard where users can highlight scales, modes, positions, or single notes.

The interface is designed for clarity and it displays nicely on smartphone devices.
