## Background

The goal of building this interactive tool, is to make it easier to learn the fretboard. I wanted something that works nicely on my smartphone. Traditional diagrams and static charts can be limiting and other apps didn't work as I wanted them to.

## How it works

*fretMonkey* presents a virtual guitar fretboard where you can highlight scales, modes, positions, or single notes.

The interface is simple and designed for clarity.
