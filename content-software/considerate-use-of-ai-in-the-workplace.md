# Considerate use of Generative AI in the Workplace

## AI Work Slop

*"The practice of using generative AI to produce long-form content, such as emails, documents, or presentations, while recipients use generative AI to summarise that same content before reading it."*

If this sounds familiar, you're not alone.

As we got used to using generative AI, many of us have been guilty of creating AI work slop at some point. Remember that excited feeling of watching AI spew out all those magnificent words, that would have taken you hours to type by yourself!

Being the recipient of AI work slop is both frustrating and unproductive. It's also likely to cause miscommunication problems, as the meaning of content gets diluted during the expansion and compression cycle.

Depending on the intended audience, the lengthy content may be useful, but it's worth asking yourself if it's necessary. If it is, then add a summary at the top, for recipients who only need a summary. You can include this in your prompt to add a summary:
*"Add a concise summary section at the top of this document."*
